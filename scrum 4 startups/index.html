    <h1>9 Tools to organize your work during the first weeks of your startup.</h1>

    <h2>1.- Prioritize your Life</h2>

    <p>Your startup should be your priority, of course you'll have a lot of others things
      to do, but lets that just work in automatic.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set Big Rocks for the Week.</li>
      <li>Set 3 Most Important Tasks for the Day(Taken most probably from the Big Rocks).</li>
      <li>Do your MITs at the start of the day, even before checking your email.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you fill a vase with sand (little rocks) and try to squis your big rocks after it,
      you'll not be able to do it, in the other hand if you put your big rocks first, then
      the sand will simply fill the empty space.

      the efforst be headed, the reality is that everything should head towards the discovery
      of the customer-product match.

      <img src="ScrumLargeLabelled.png" width="700"/>
      SCRUM as other metodologies work in small cycles because it has several benefits.
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Daily Scrums provide near deadlines in a friendly and confident environment.</li>
      <li>
        2 Weeks delivery cycles allows the team to focus on a fixed set of task witout the
        burden of a long project.
      </li>
      <li>Gather feedback faster, allowing the team to pivot easily based in hard data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In one word, it's <b>humanized</b>.</p>

    <h2>6.- Product Backlog</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>As a &lt;role&gt; I need &lt;a feature&gt; that provides &lt;value&gt;</li>
      <li>Estimation</li>
      <li>Return of Investment</li>
      <li>
          I.N.V.E.S.T. -> Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimatable, Small, Testable.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7.- Poker Planning</h2>
    <p>
      A method to put everyone in the same page about the size of the tasks to be done,
      by voting with cards about the size of the tasks with a set of poker cards.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It's called poker because as poker, you play it with cards and try to avoid to give tips to the others about what card you are playing.
      </li>
      <li>We use cards A(1), 2, 4, 8, J(16), Q(32), K(64) to assing time because humans are lousy
        estimators and something we say is going to take little bit more, is usually done in the
        double of time.
      </li>
      <li>Tasks usually have hidden complications, so exact times wouldn't cut it anyway.</li>
      <li>When voting, if there is someone that votes to high or to low, it's usually because
        he knows something the others not(maybe a not obvious software limitation for example), he
        explains it and then the team votes again.
      </li>
      <li>The not exact units ^(hrs|days|etc) used are later converted in time as the team starts
        to syncronize in estimations and work output.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8.- SCRUM Board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical, always visible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9.- Minifesto</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fight for Pareto</b>'s law, look for the 20% of effort that will give you the 80% of results.</li>
      <li><b>Prioritize</b>, minimalism isn't about not doing things but about focusing first in the important.</li>
      <li><b>Perfect is enemy of good</b>, first do it, then do it right, then do it better.</li>
      <li><b>Kill the baby</b>, don't be afraid of starting all over again. Fail soon, learn fast.</li>
      <li><b>Add value</b>. Think constantly how you can help your team and position yourself in that field/skill.</li>
      <li><b>Basics, first.</b> Follow always a top-down thinking starting by the best-practises of CS.</li>
      <li><b>Think different.</b> Simple is harder than complex, which means you'll need to use your creativity.</li>
      <li><b>Synthesis</b> is the key of communication. We have to write code for humans not machines.</li>
      <li><b>Keep it plane.</b> Try to keep your designs with few layers of indirection.</li>
      <li><b>Clean kippel</b> and redundancy. Minimalism is all about removing distractions.</li>
    </ul>
